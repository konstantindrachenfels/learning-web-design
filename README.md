# learning-web-design
These are some projects I did to get accommodated with the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JS) during a course at emlyon.

They are at a very basic level and introduced me into the field of web design. I organized the respective projects into different branches.
1. Image classification
--> I reproduced an image classifier based on the coding train from Daniel Shiffman that lets one create and train new classes with the CNN MobileNet.

2. Get me home
--> This was a group project supervised by a web design freelancer in which we needed to come up with a novel App idea, create wireframes with figma and then a web presentation and documentation which explains and advertises our project.
--> Our idea was an App which would automatically track an estimation of your blood alcohol level based on your vital information and consumption of alcohol and then order you an uber automatically to pick you up and bring you home the moment you leave the bar if your blood alcohol level has passed a certain limit.

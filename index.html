    <h1>Create your personalised image classifier</h1>

    <h2>
      You are sick of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) out there?
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      Wait, you are probably asking yourself now: "What the heck is a
      convolutional neural network?". Well, the CNNs are the tools you use to
      automatically analyze, classify and label images. If you wanna look at a
      more in-depth definition
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network"
      >
        click here</a
      >! So, CNNs are a pretty great thing. They make the benefits of machine
      learning in the area of image recognition useable for everyone. In fact,
      there are some out there, like
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://mc.ai/mobilenet-the-whos-who-of-faster-cnn-classifier"
      >
        MobileNet</a
      >
      , who are really fast and easy to use. If you rather want more
      sophisticated outputs and are thus willing to use a larger, slower and
      more complex CNNs you might want to have a look at some other solutions
      like
      <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43022">
        GoogLeNet</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>
      So, why should you be sick of them if they are so great???
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      Well, once you take a closer look you will find out that these CNNs are
      only as good as the image libraries they use. Let us take the userfriendly
      MobileNet for example. MobileNet uses the images from
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.image-net.org/"> ImageNet</a>
      to train it's algorithm. This is great as ImageNet includes more than
      <strong> 14 million </strong> images! Nonetheless, ImageNet is not a
      professional database designed to represent everything there is. This
      means that it includes a lot of pictures of Chihuahuas as they are cute
      and adorable and hence you will have a high likelihood of MobileNet to
      correctly recognize Chihuahuas. If you rather want MobileNet to recognize
      something rare and special like a
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka"> Quokka</a>
      , it will not be able to recognize these adorable creatures as it has not
      been trained to do so. This is so as there has not been created a category
      for Quokkas in ImageNet. There exist a little more than
      <strong> 20.000 </strong> categories in ImageNet. Humans are for example
      also not categorized. Thus, MobileNet will not be able to recognize you or
      any other person.

    <h2>
      Train MobileNet to recognize something unique!
    </h2>
   <p class="text">
    You might be looking into this whole image recognition area because you want
    the CNN to recognize something special like your friends, favorite stuffed
    animals or whatsoever. If that wasn't the reason that you looked into CNNs,
    well then you might be pumped to try this out now! But how do you do that?
    There has been offered a really easy and user friendly way to do so using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://ml5js.org/"> ml5</a>. So ml5 is this
    awesome open source library developed by NYU professors and many more
    developers from all over the world. I really strongly encourage you to check
    out their website. The best way to figre out what you all can do with ml5 is
    to browse through the examples on the website or to check out the

    <h2>
      How to code the training process
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      So, let's get to the coding! As i said, we will be using ml5. Hence, the
      first step is to make a reference to their library in our html.
    </p>
    <p class="img">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2FReference.JPG?v=1572691603884"
      />
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The current version of ml5, when I wrote this article, is this version
      0.4.1. This might not be the case when you are reading the article. Hence,
      you should check out their website and make sure that you reference to the
      newest version.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Once we have created the link, the first step is to extract the already
      existing features in MobileNet and to create a new classifier using these
      features.
    </p>
    <p class="img">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2FExtractor.JPG?v=1572694844278"
      />
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This is quite easy as ml5 has created these predefined functions
      "featureExtractor" and "classification". Now, as you can see in this
      example we are reffering to the variable "video". This is so as I will
      show you how to create new classes from pictures you will take with your
      webcam. This is the most convenient way to create unique classes with
      stuff only you have.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Hence, we need to define the variable "video" now.
    </p>
    <p class="img">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2FVideo.JPG?v=1572695176848"
      />
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Now your webcam should be streaming a video of you on your website.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      As your website now needs to load the whole MobileNet library and the
      video you ask some performance from your laptop, even if MobileNet is
      already a pretty light CNN. Hence, Daniel Shiffman comes up with the
      suggestion to create functions which tell you when MobileNet and video are
      loaded and ready. As I think this is pretty useful, I suggest you to do
      the same using the following functions.
    </p>
    <p class="img">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2Fready.JPG?v=1572695580144"
      />
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Now, that you've defined that you want to create a new class, you have to
      make some pictures to feed MobileNet with examples. That way MobileNet is
      able to train itself with your examples in the next step. As we have
      already set up the video, we now need to create a button and define that a
      picture is taken once the button is pressed. In our example I defined the
      classes we want to add as "brother" and "sister" so that you could get
      MobileNet on your website to recognize your siblings whenever they look
      into the camera. As I have said before, you can define virtually every
      class you like and combine it with any picture you like. You could also
      make pcitures of apples and define the class as banana so that MobileNet
      will recognize the apple as banana if that is what you feel like. ðŸ˜‰
    </p>
    <p class="img">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2Fdefineclass.JPG?v=1572696482300"
      />
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      As you can see, i've also defined a variable which keeps track of the
      number of pictures that you are taking. That is useful since the number of
      pictures you will be taking upfront will define how accurate MobileNet
      will be to recognize your class. So, make sure that you take the pictures
      out of different angles too!
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The next step is to train MobileNet with the pictures we have just taken.
      Luckily, ml5 has the predefined functions "train" and "loss" which make
      this step incredibly easy for us.
    </p>

    <p class="img">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2FTraining.JPG?v=1572697244787"
      />
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      "Loss", if you are wondering, keeps track how often the CNN labels our
      image wrong. Hence, we want to make sure that this percentage gets reduced
      to a number really close to zero in the training process.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Now our images are trained and classified! Hence, we want to check out if
      it worked.
    </p>
    <p class="img">
    <img
      src="https://cdn.glitch.com/0d36063b-8b4b-4154-9026-9eb380b8cf5d%2FTryout.JPG?v=1572697531156"
    />
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      These last functions create the image classifier. Now, you can see if your
      classifier is able to recognize your new classes and to what probability.
      So I suggest you have fun and try your classifier!

      Belling the Cat

    <p>
      The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of
      their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing
      when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed,
      something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her
      claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day. Many
      plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a
      very young Mouse got up and said: "I have a plan that seems very simple,
      but I know it will be successful. All we have to do is to hang a bell
      about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know
      immediately that our enemy is coming." All the Mice were much surprised
      that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the
      rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: "I will
      say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one
      question: Who will bell the Cat?"

      Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a
      widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant
      leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree. "How useless is the Plane!"
      said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter
      the ground with leaves." "Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the
      Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am
      useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"

      A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree,
      when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to
      make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously
      about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with
      his work. "Why are you doing that?" asked the Fox at last with a grin.
      "There isn't any danger that I can see." "True enough," replied the Boar,
      "but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this.
      My weapons will have to be ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it."

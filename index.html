      <p>
        Daniel Kahneman is an Israeli-American psychologist and economist
        notable for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making,
        as well as behavioral economics, for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel
        Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. His empirical findings challenge
        the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic
        theory. With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive
        basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases and
        developed prospect theory. In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy
        magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In the same year, his book
        Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was
        published and became a best seller.
